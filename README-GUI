There's a new GUI. It uses JS and HTML. You need emscripten to build it.
I'll probably going to make it into a xulrunner app.

THERE ARE STILL SOME BIG-ENOUGH-THAT-I-CAN-SPOT-THEM BUGS,
for example it seems to crash on `sorted' in `test.txt'.

Note: the file gui/emcc-template.html is based on the file 
"emscripten/src/shell.html" of the emscripten tree.

To build, do this:

$ ./build-gui.sh

If all goes well, the folder `final' will contain a XUL app.

If you have `xulrunner' (the XUL runtime) installed, you can do:

$ ./run-gui.sh

Once the GUI is compiled it is fairly easy to make a distributable
"standalone" package by packaging in the XUL runtime and writing a tiny
script. XUL supports various platforms, etc.
