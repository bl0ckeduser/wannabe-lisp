There's a new GUI. It is XUL(runner)-based. 
It is written in JS and HTML. You need emscripten to build it.

The main reason I wrote it is to get parentheses flashing.
There is room for improvements...

NOTE: at the following URL is a compiled build of the JS/HTML GUI, 
built on 8 August 2013:
https://sites.google.com/site/bl0ckeduserssoftware/wannabelisp-compiledgui-20130808.tar.gz

As of writing, the GUI version is kind of slow, unfortunately.
There might be a way to get it to be faster with "asm.js", but that thing
needs lots of tweaking to get to work.. arghl

Note: the file gui/emcc-template.html is based on the file 
"emscripten/src/shell.html" of the emscripten tree.

To build, do this:

$ ./build-gui.sh

If all goes well, the folder `final' will contain a XUL app.

If you have `xulrunner' (the XUL runtime) installed, you can do:

$ ./run-gui.sh

Once the GUI is compiled it is fairly easy to make a distributable
"standalone" package by packaging in the XUL runtime and writing a tiny
script. XUL supports various platforms, etc.
