There's a new GUI. It is XUL(runner)-based. 
It is written in JS and HTML. You need emscripten to build it.

The main reason I wrote it is to get parentheses flashing.
It is a terrible hack. There is (massive) room for improvements...
It assumes lots of things about your keyboard that might not be
true if you don't have the same kind of keyboard as I do.
Proper menus and a proper keyboard driver would be nice.

At the following URL is acompiled build of the JS/HTML GUI, built 
on 25 August 2013: 
  https://sites.google.com/site/bl0ckeduserssoftware/wlisp-win32-20130825.7z
(Note that it has the Win32 xulrunner distributable preincluded)

And here's a screenshot:

As of writing, the GUI version is kind of slow, unfortunately.
There might be a way to get it to be faster with "asm.js", but that thing
needs lots of tweaking to get to work.. arghl

Note: the file gui/emcc-template.html is based on the file 
"emscripten/src/shell.html" of the emscripten tree.

To build, do this:

$ ./build-gui.sh

If all goes well, the folder `final' will contain a XUL app.

If you have `xulrunner' (the XUL runtime) installed, you can do:

$ ./run-gui.sh

Once the GUI is compiled it is fairly easy to make a distributable
"standalone" package by packaging in the XUL runtime and writing a tiny
script. XUL supports various platforms, etc.

		An additional note on emscripten
		================================

emscripten is a special beast.

in fact you might not get it to compile this thing with its
latest version. for reference, I use the following version:

1.4.7 (commit a1eb425371aa310e074b06d80d56adf71d6f5383)

which I downloaded around June 2013.
