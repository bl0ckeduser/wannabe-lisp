Babby's first toy lisp (scheme) interpreter

Based on the examples given in the SICP videos
(http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/)

See test.txt, closure.txt for example code
To build and run the code, do

$ make
$ ./lisp <test.txt

Optionally, composite car/cdr primitives (like caddr) can be built thusly:

$ python gen-cadr.py >prefix.txt 


There are some important things missing; see `TODO'
